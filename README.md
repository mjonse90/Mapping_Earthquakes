# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview

The Disaste Reporting Network has requested an interactive web application that displays earthquakes from around the world over the previous 7 days. I used CSS, Javascript and HTML to show the magnitudes of earthquakes according to US Geological Survey website. Leaflet.js and D3.js libraries as well as GeoJSON data were utilized to add overlay layers for users to interact with.


## Software
VS Code \ CSS \ Javascript ES6 \ HTML \ d3.js \ Leaflet.js
